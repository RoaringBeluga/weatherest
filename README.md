# WeatheRest
### Small REST API wrapper project in Python

For now, it mostly is useful as a testing tool with pytest. Code in the _main.py_ is outdated a bit, all the work was done in the ./test directory.

Modules:

__apitherapy__ wraps _requests_ framework. Not like it is much needed, but it looked like a fun idea to add some parameter restrictions to HTTP requests.

__weatherest__ builds upon it to wrap [http://openweathermap.com](OpenWeatherMap's REST API) and is a WIP for now
